KCC will be developed in three phases: KCC 1.0, KCC 2.0, and KCC 3.0.

We are still in KCC 1.0, but as the developer community expands and the community becomes more vibrant, we will gradually begin to research and develop KCC 2.0.

**With KCC 2.0, we aim to improve the user experience, boost performance, and encourage more developers to build on KCC:**

* **Accounts Abstraction:** KCC2.0 will support the ERC4337 wallet, making it much easier for Web2 users to access their wallets. It is possible for them to make payments in the same manner as they do with PayPal or Google Pay. There is no need to memorize private keys or mnemonics. Additionally, they can recover and freeze their wallets just like in a Web2 application. If there are not enough KCS to cover transaction fees, stablecoins in the wallet can be used to cover gas fees.
* **Performance Improvement:** KCC2.0 will improve the execution of EVM codes, storage of states, and synchronization of states, transactions, and blocks.
* **Gas Incentives**: KCC2.0 will share the gas income with dApp developers, just like YouTubers share the advertisement income from Youtube.

**KCC 3.0 aims to become more resilient and to build an ecosystem of multiple rollups:**

* **Settlement Layer And DA Layer For Rollups**: KCC 3.0 will become the global settlement layer and DA layer for all rollups that run on KCC. Moreover, zk-rollups running on KCC 3.0 will be synchronously composable, which means a smart contract on one zk-rollup can synchronously call the smart contract on some other zk-rollup.
* **Client Diversity:** KCC 3.0 will implement more node clients. The diversity of node clients will make KCC more resilient.
