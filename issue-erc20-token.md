# Issue ERC20 Token

ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created on the EVM-compatible blockchain. An ERC20 token contract keeps track of _fungible_ tokens: any token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a **medium of exchange currency**, **voting rights**, **staking**, and more.
